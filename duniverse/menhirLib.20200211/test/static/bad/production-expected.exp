A production is expected at this point.
A production is a sequence of producers, followed with a semantic action.
Examples of well-formed producers:
  expr
  option(COMMA)
  separated_list(COMMA, expr)
  e = expr
  ds = declaration*
  es = list(terminated(expr, SEMI))
  es = list(e = expr SEMI { e })
  xs = list(x = var { Some x } | WILDCARD { None })
